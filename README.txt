Hi! Welcome to my second java project. I used eclipse to create a fun program for managing customers in a drink reward program. The project description is in the pdf file. I did everything except the drink customization feature directions were a little confusing, so at the direction of my professor I just commented all of the functions having to do with that out. I never tested those so they might be broken, but I'm fairly sure the rest of this program works as expected. Keep in mind that the program must have orders and customers to run properly, otherwise it will exit with from unhandled exceptions.
